# Flower recognition

A neural network model to identify the image of a flower and classify it into one of the five classes - daisy/dandelion/rose/sunflower/tulip.
This is a tranfer learning model that uses the pretrained mobilenet from tensorflow to recognize flowers.

The model performs well with **97%** accuracy on training data and **91%** accuracy on test data.

Some random flower images obtained from google images, apart from training and test data, are also included in the repository for testing.
