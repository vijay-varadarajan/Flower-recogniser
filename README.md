# Flower recognition

A neural network model to identify the image of a flower and classify it into one of the five classes - daisy/dandelion/rose/sunflower/tulip.
This is a tranfer learning model that uses the pretrained mobilenet from tensorflow to recognize flowers.
The model performs with around 90.7% accuracy in both training and test data.

Some random flower images obtained from google images, apart from training and test data, are also included in the repository for testing.
